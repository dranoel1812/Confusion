You awaken to find yourself confused, disorientated, and also confused and disorientated. The frst thing you notice is the absence of your faithful friend and companion of many minutes, Martin, the polar bear slightly smaller than a really really big frog. There is a door to the north, another door to the west, and a window in the south south east of the very strangely shaped room. You also notice the alarming absence of a huge frog with which you would normally compare Martin. This causes you such distress that you fall unconscious, and have to back to the top of the paragraph when you wake up.

As you enter the ADDR, you are amazed by the amount of tragically destroyed bits of Polars Bears and Frogs-it is really horrible.
